# This is a fork of react-native-document-picker with Android Persistable Permission so as to get permanent access to content:// URI

Original Package: 
# react-native-document-picker: https://github.com/Elyx0/react-native-document-picker

⚠️ NOTE: since version 3.3.2 we're using git version tags prefixed with `v`, eg. `v3.3.2`. This is a standard format and should mean no changes to your workflows.

⚠️ Breaking: New Interface: use v2 branch if you need to go back.
PR are welcome to add what's missing.
